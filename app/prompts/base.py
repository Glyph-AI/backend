USER INPUT: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.
Action: Document Search
Action Input: Colorodo orogeny
Observation: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.
Action: Document Search
Action Input: Colorado orogeny, eastern sector
Observation: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action: Document Search
Action Input: Colorodo orogeny, easter sector, high plains
Observation: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action: Google Search
Action Input: High Plains, United States
Observation: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]
Thought: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
