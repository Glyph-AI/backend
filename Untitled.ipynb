He said to the woman, \"Did God say, \\'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden\\'?\"\\n[3:2] The woman said to the serpent, \"We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;\\n[3:3] but God said, \\'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. \\'\"\\n[3:4] But the serpent said to the woman, \"You will not die;\\n[3:5] for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\"\\n[3:6] So'"
